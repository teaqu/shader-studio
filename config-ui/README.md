# Shader Configuration UI

This directory contains the Svelte-based user interface for the shader configuration editor, which provides a visual interface for editing `.sv.json` files.

## Structure

- `src/` - Source code for the Svelte application
  - `lib/components/` - Svelte components
  - `lib/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
  - `lib/stores/` - Svelte stores for state management
- `dist/` - Built application (generated by Vite)
- `public/` - Static assets

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests
npm run test
```

## Integration

The built application is served by the VS Code extension's ConfigEditorProvider, which loads the generated HTML and assets from the `dist/` directory to provide a custom editor experience for `.sv.json` files.

## Features

- Visual configuration editing
- Real-time validation
- Buffer pass management
- Input channel configuration
- VS Code theme integration
