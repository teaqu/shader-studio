# Change Log
### 1.1.1

- Fixed scripts not loading, missing uniform values, and scripts running while paused.
- Fixed variable inspector clicks and hover previews sometimes not working.
- Fixed the GLSL language server not recognising Common-file `#define` macros.
- Fixed helper files replacing the shader preview and GLSL-to-JavaScript conversion failing.

### 1.1.0
- Write shaders in Slang as well as GLSL, with the same preview, config panel, inputs, and debugging.
- Run compute passes over storage buffers and read the results from your image pass.
- Render onto 3D geometry: load a GLB model, orbit the camera around it, and light it with the surface position and normal. Each pass chooses 2D or 3D.
- Move vertices before they are shaded with a vertex shader, in either language.
- GLSL and Slang language servers: completions, hover documentation, errors as you type, go to definition, find references, rename, symbol highlighting, colour swatches, and greyed-out unused variables — across your Common file and imports.
- Debug Slang shaders: inspect values line by line, follow them into imported files, and see which lines never ran.
- Browse your shaders from the sidebar, with previews, renaming, and deletion.
- Watch GPU time per frame in the performance panel to see whether the GPU or the frame loop is the bottleneck.
- Name buffer passes anything you like, and rename them from the config tabs.
- Use a video file as an audio input, and mute channels individually — muting is saved with the shader.
- Open a shader in the browser with the same docked layout as the panel.
- Toggle the shader lock with `Ctrl+L` / `Cmd+L`.
- Spell checking knows shader vocabulary, and the Shader Validator extension no longer conflicts.
- Fixes: a broken config reports the error instead of showing a black frame, error markers no longer linger after the code is fixed, the mouse position holds still while paused and follows hover, and cubemaps work in the variable inspector.

### 1.0.2
- Added a toggleable canvas marker for the locked pixel inspector position, with the preference persisted across sessions.

### 1.0.1
- Fixed extension activation in published installs when the script bundler dependency is not present in the VSIX.

### 1.0.0
- First stable release of Shader Studio.
- Live Shadertoy-style GLSL previews in VS Code panels, external windows, and browsers.
- Visual configuration editor for multi-pass shaders with textures, video, audio, cubemaps, buffers, keyboard input, and common/script passes.
- Visual debugging tools including pixel inspection, inline rendering, variable capture, normalization, loop controls, and parameter controls.
- Monaco editor overlay with compile modes, shader locking, panel layout persistence, and profile management.
- Shader Explorer, snippet library, time controls, recording, resolution controls, camera uniforms, and performance tooling.
- Improved documentation, marketplace assets, and release packaging for VS Code Marketplace, Open VSX, and GitHub Releases.
